    "**Game of Life** is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. If you happen not to have heard of the Game of Life before, try it out yourself at [this website](https://playgameoflife.com/) and see what it is about. It's not a *game* in the traditional sense, because there are no players, rather a simulation of an evolving system (often referred to as a *zero-player game*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The universe of the Game of Life is a two-dimensional grid of squares (cells), each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or 1 and 0). At each step in time, some cells are born, some die, and some stay the same, according to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A live cell with **fewer than two** live neighbors **dies** of underpopulation.\n",
    "2. A live cell with **two or three** live neighbors **lives** on to the next generation.\n",
    "3. A live cell with **more than three** live neighbors **dies** of overpopulation.\n",
    "4. A dead cell with **exactly three** live neighbors becomes a live cell as if by reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user is supposed to draw some initial configuration of live and dead cells and watch how the system evolves with time. Not all initial configurations of cells will lead to interesting results. Some will die out in a few time steps, but some will evolve into complex shapes with really cool properties. I highly encourage you to play around with the Game of Life yourself before we implement it in Pyhton.\n",

    "Implement the Game of Life's board as class `GameOfLife`. The class should have the following methods:\n",
    "- `__init__(self, width, height, prob)`: Initializes a random Game of Life board (in terms of live and dead cells) of the given width and height. Creates the board using the `get_random_board` method and stores it in the instance variable `self.board` (already done for you).\n",

    "- `set_cell(self, x, y, state)`: Sets the cell at position (x, y) to the given state (1 for live, 0 for dead).\n",
    "\n",
